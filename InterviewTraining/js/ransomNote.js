Ransom Note Problem

You're given a stack of magazine clippings (characters) and need to determine if you
can create a specific ransom note (note) using only these clippings. Each character
from the magazine can only be used once.

The Problem:
Given:
1. characters: String representing all letters cut from magazines
2. note: The ransom note you want to create

Return true if you can create the note, false if you don't have enough characters.

Rules:
- Each character/clipping can only be used once
- Characters are case sensitive ('A' is different from 'a')
- You can't create characters you don't have
- Spaces and punctuation marks count as characters

Examples:

Input:
characters = "I love programming"
note = "I am pro"
Output: true
Explanation:
- All needed characters exist in the magazine clippings
- Note that we still have unused characters, which is fine

Input:
characters = "Give me the money!"
note = "Give me more money!"
Output: false
Explanation:
- We need the word "more" but don't have those letters available

Input:
characters = "Hello hello"
note = "Hello"
Output: true
Explanation:
- Even though we have "hello" twice in characters
- We only need one "Hello" for our note
- Case sensitivity matters!

Parameters:
- characters: String of available magazine clippings
- note: String to create (the ransom note)

Return:
- boolean: true if note can be created, false otherwise

Hints:
- Think about keeping track of available letters
- Consider using a frequency counter
- Be careful with case sensitivity
