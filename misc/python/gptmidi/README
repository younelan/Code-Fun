# LLM Midi generation

most chatbots will not generate midi files if prompted. However, they understand music theory and will happily create a song in text file format

They will even create a program to convert the generated text file with notes into a midi file

the 2 programs provided where generated by chatbots.


To generate a song:
- open code editor
- put the python program into the context
- ask the chatbot to create a song as input. For example you can ask for a pop song with a typical chord progression
- both programs work but I personally find the json one better, multi tracks are supported
- save the created input file and run it through the midi converter
- the json is converted into a midi file.
- open the midi file in your favorite daw
