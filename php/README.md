miscphp repo
============

This repository contains misc PHP code I wrote a very long time ago.

_ template_helper.php - a simple forms generation engine with the option to validate input
_ form_helper.php - a simple theme engine - basically substitutes variables in the template. If you need something sophisticated, I recommend either tiny but strong or smarty
